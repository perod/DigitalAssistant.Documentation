#### How do I enter expenses using Wanda?

You can tell Wanda you want to make an expense claim by saying something like _submit expenses_, or you can upload an image of a receipt and Wanda will extract the necessary information and guide you through the rest of the expense claim process. Wanda helps you to submit expense claims for single expense items such as a book purchase, as well as for travel expense items such as transport, hotel and meals incurred during a single-destination trip.

When you add an expense item, Wanda asks you to include it in an expense claim with the relevant cost categories which you can then add more expense items to as required. You can save an expense claim as a draft to complete later either using Wanda or later in Business World.

Once you've completed your expense claim, Wanda then submits it to Business World for approval and keeps you posted on its status.

#### How do I upload an image of my receipt?

Wanda uses receipt recognition to read an image file of your receipt and extract whatâ€™s needed to process your expense claim. You can upload an image of your receipt as a PNG, JPEG, TIFF or  PDF file.

Wanda best recognizes images which have a clear background with good contrast. Images should also be in focus and taken as head on as possible to give Wanda the best chance of being able to read it correctly.

> Note that images uploaded to Facebook Messenger cannot be analyzed due to the way the image is resized by Messenger.

#### Why does Wanda ask me to give a description for cost categories?
When you enter an expense claim you'll normally be asked to provide cost categories such as project and cost center etc for accounting purposes. Since you probably use the same cost categories for similar types of expense claims, Wanda makes this part easier by letting you assign short descriptive names or labels to your cost category information and then you only need to pick this name when using the same cost categories in the future.

#### Why can't I attach images in Microsoft Teams?

If you're using the web or desktop versions of Microsoft Teams, then due to a current limitation in Teams, the paperclip icon is missing as default from your Wanda chat channel. This means you're not able to directly attach image files to your chats with Wanda but there is a temporary workaround.

If the paperclip icon is missing from your Wanda chat channel, then to attach image files to your chat you need to open your image file in Microsoft Paint or the default image viewer in Windows 10, select the image and then copy and paste it into the Wanda chat window using the keyboard commands **Ctrl-C** and **Ctrl-V**.
