## Using Wanda Companion

<a class="anchor" id="wandacompanionwhat"></a>
#### What is Wanda Companion?
Wanda Companion is an app that you can download to your smart phone from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/no/app/wanda-companion/id1247392211?mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unit4.wanda_companion) to allow Wanda to record time spent at locations you've visited during the day, as well as allowing you to manually record time spent on various activities. Wanda then uses this information to generate timesheet proposals, or calculate your time spent traveling between locations. The generated information is used exclusively by Wanda and isn't visible to anyone else.

You define where and when Wanda tracks and categorizes your time, and Wanda will never track or record any information unless specifically defined by you.

#### How do I set up locations and stopwatches?

Your list of locations and stopwatches (activities) are the things you want Wanda to track your time for. You can add, change or delete locations and stopwatches from within the app at any time.

##### Locations

 > Note that if you want Wanda to track your locations automatically then make sure the *Location* setting is set to **Always**. You'll find the *Location* for Wanda Companion in your phone's settings.
 
Locations are places you spend time in during your working week, such as your regular office, other company sites and your home office. You add a location to your by giving it a meaningful name, searching for its location using the interactive map or address lookup, and then setting its area size.

Once you add a location, Wanda then registers the time you spend there using GPS tracking and adds this information to your **Recent events** list. Wanda then uses this information to provide timesheet proposals which you can then accept, reject or change as required. 


##### Stopwatches

You can define stopwatches for your activities, for example projects or travel time between locations, and then use these to manually record the time you spend on each of them during the day. Wanda also adds this information to your **Recent events** and uses it along with your location information to provide timesheet proposals.

#### Does Wanda Companion record my time when I'm not signed in?
Wanda Companion only records your location and activity information when you're signed in to the Wanda Companion app. If you sign out from the app, then your location information is no longer stored and any running stopwatches are stopped. When you sign in again, then Wanda Companion resumes storing your location information and any running stopwatches are restarted.
