## Learn about Wanda

<a name= "wandawhat"></a>
#### What is Wanda?

Wanda is your Unit4 digital assistant and is available as a contact through Microsoft Teams, Skype, Facebook Messenger or Slack to help with these simple, everyday Business World tasks:

*   Submit absence and travel requests, timesheets and expense claims
*   See your HR related info such as payslips, and vacation and overtime balances
*   Raise simple purchase requests for internal items such as computer and office supplies
*   Manage the tasks in your Task list

Since Wanda's skills are regularly updated she'll be able to help you with a wider range of things in the future.

#### Why use Wanda? 

Wanda is available anytime on your device meaning you don't need to access Business World to take care of your Business World tasks. For example, if youâ€™re on a business trip you can easily keep track of your running expenses by telling Wanda about each expense as it occurs or uploading a picture of each receipt to let Wanda compile your expense claim.

Wanda is also able to act as your assistant and proactively help you by giving you reminders, keep you posted on the status of your requests and make suggestions for things such as timesheets. Wanda can also learn which projects, work orders and cost centers you're normally assigned to based on your activities and work patterns, and use this information to make it smoother for you to do your tasks.

The more you work with Wanda, the more she will learn your work patterns and preferences and the better she will get at being your assistant.

####How do I talk to Wanda?

**Word choice**

It's best to use short, simple sentences and normal terms for the things you want help with, for example _Show my salary slip._, _I'll be absent tomorrow._ or _How many holidays do I have left?_. Avoid using single words as these can be ambiguous, for example saying _Holiday_ can mean you either want to submit an absence request for a holiday or see your holiday balance. If Wanda isn't sure about how to answer your request, then ask you to choose how she should respond.

**Switching between tasks**

If you ask Wanda to do help you with a task, for example submit a timesheet, and you want to switch to another task, then you must cancel the current conversation first by saying **quit** before you can ask Wanda to help you with the new task.

**Making choices with action buttons**

Action buttons are used to help you make choices and guide you through the conversation. However, be aware that action buttons are only valid at the point in the conversation where they're presented. This means you can't go back to an earlier point in the conversation and choose an action button that's been presented earlier, as that action is then applied to the most recent message and is no longer valid.

#### What if Wanda doesn't understand my request?
If Wanda doesn't understand you or gives you an unexpected reply, then try to rephrase your request and try using different key words.

If Wanda doesn't understand the way you enter dates, then try another date format or try to give precise dates. For example, instead of saying "*I want to travel from Wednesday to Friday next week.*", try saying "*I want to travel from Wednesday June 10 to Friday June 12.*", or "*I want to travel from 10/06/2017 to 12/06/2017.*"

#### Why do I need to sign in to my work or organization account?
You need to sign in to your work or organization account to give Wanda access to Business World to allow her to help you with your requests. Think of it as opening a secure channel from within your social media app to your Business World account which Wanda can then use to communicate with Business World on your behalf.

If you're not signed in and you ask Wanda to help you with something, then she'll ask you to sign in. You can also sign in by simply saying _signin_ or _login_ and Wanda will then guide you through the process.

#### How do I sign out from Wanda?
To sign out from your work or organization when using Wanda just say _signout_ or  _logout_. You're then signed out of your session with Wanda and you'll need to sign in again the next time you need help.

If you're using Wanda on a device that's accessible to others, then we strongly recommend that you sign out when you're done to prevent others from potentially accessing and using Wanda on your behalf.

#### How do I quit a conversation?
If you want to break out of the current conversation you can quit it at any time by saying **quit**, **exit** or **stop** and Wanda then stops whatever she's doing. Actions that are already registered, such as single expenses lines and completed days of your timesheet, are saved as a draft and any actions that aren't registered, such as incomplete travel or absence requests, are canceled.

#### Which languages does Wanda understand?
Wanda currently understands English, Spanish, Swedish and Norwegian and she'll be able to understand other languages as these get added. You can also ask Wanda: _Which languages do you understand?_, and she'll give you the current list. 

Wanda's default language is English but you can change this at any time by asking Wanda to change your preferences by saying _Change language_ or _Change preferences_. If you change your language then Wanda continues talking to you in this language until you change it again, and remembers your language if you sign out of you session and sign back in again.

#### Why does Wanda cancel a conversation?
If you start a conversation and Wanda is waiting for a response from you, if you don't respond within 20 minutes then Wanda assumes you don't want to continue the conversation and cancels it. Wanda is then ready to help you with a new task.

* Language &mdash; If you change language Wanda remembers your choice until you change back 
* Notifications &mdash; Wanda will send you notifications about things like tasks you have been assigned
* New skills &mdash; Wanda will tell you when she has learned a new skill
* Conversation choices &mdash; If Wanda is unsure what you mean she'll sometimes give you a choice of how she should respond and she'll then remember this choice for next time

#### Does Wanda understand emojis?
Wanda understands the most basic set of emojis. However, sometimes an emoji can have more than one meaning depending on how and where it's used, so Wanda might occasionally misunderstand if you use emojis. If this happens then just say what you mean instead to avoid confusion.

#### Can I start a conversation in Microsoft Teams and continue it in Skype?
When you start a conversation with Wanda the session is created and maintained in the same social media channel that the conversation is started in. This means that if you start a conversation in one social media channel, such as Microsoft Teams, then you can't resume the conversation later using another social media channel such as Skype.

However, the information that you include in your chats with Wanda is subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of your social media channel provider (Microsoft Teams, Skype or Slack) which you must accept to use their service, as well as the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the [Microsoft Bot Framework](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) upon which Wanda is built.
