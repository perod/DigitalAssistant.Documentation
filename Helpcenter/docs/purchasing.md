#### What kind of items can I purchase using Wanda?
Wanda can help you to submit a purchase request for single items such as computer equipment, mobile devices and office supplies etc. from your company's internal product catalog. Once the purchase request is generated Wanda sends it for approval and keeps you informed of its status.

#### I didn't complete my purchase request. Is it saved as a draft?
If you leave your purchase request conversation before it gets completed, then a draft purchase requisition is kept on the Business World web app. You will then need to sign in to Business World to complete your request.
