## How we protect your privacy when using the Unit4 Digital Assistant

We're committed to protecting your personal data and privacy and under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) you have full control over how your personal data is stored and used. This section covers how you can exercise your rights under the GDPR when you use Wanda.

#### To delete your personal data from Wanda

You can exercise your right to erasure and ask Wanda to delete any personal data that's stored for you. This means Wanda will delete:

   * All previous conversations on all the social media channels you've used to chat with Wanda
   * Any preferences youâ€™ve chosen to save
   * The mapping of your social media accounts to your organization account

To delete your personal data from Wanda simply use the following command in a chat message: 

    #forgetme

Wanda then asks for confirmation and lets you know when the process is completed.


<div style="background-color: #D0EB90">
<p>Note that the following personal data is outside the scope of this process:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any data submitted and stored in Unit4 Business World, such as expense claims, travel requests and timesheets. See the Unit4 Business World GDPR guidelines for more details.</li>

<li>Any personal data that might be stored by your social media provider when you have been using Wanda. See your social media provider's privacy policy for more details. </li>
</ul>
</div>

#### To withdraw your personal consent 
You can withdraw your consent at any time when using Wanda for the following permissions:

* Use your user profile
* Use your user identifier
* Use your social media user identifier
* Use chat messages
* Remember you (offline access)

To do withdraw your consent simply use the following command in a chat message:

	#withdrawconsent

You're then presented with the permissions you consented to when you first signed in to Wanda, and here you can withdraw each or all of these as required. 

#### To export your personal data from Wanda

You can get a copy of the personal data that Wanda stores about you by sending an email to <a href=mailto:wanda@u4pp.com?Subject=Export%20my%20personal%20data" target=_top">wanda@u4pp.com</a>. 

You'll then receive an email containing an attached file with the personal data that Wanda has stored for you.
