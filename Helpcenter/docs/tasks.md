#### How does Wanda help me approve my tasks? 

If you're a manager then you can quickly do your tasks in Wanda. If you need to review a task first,  then you can do this in the Wanda Tasks web view. Wanda flags your important tasks and sends you notifications when tasks have been assigned to you or when a task is due to help ensure that your tasks are done on time.

If you're an employee then Wanda keeps you up-to-date on the status of your submitted absence, travel and purchase requests, as well as your expense claims.

#### Which tasks can Wanda help me with?
Wanda can currently help you with the following types of task:

* Absences
* Timesheets
* Travel expenses
* Travel requests
* Requisitions
* Goods receipts

This means that if you have responsibility for approving other types of tasks such as sales orders, then Wanda won’t help you with these and you’ll need to continue to take care of them in Business World like you do now.
