#### What kind of self-service HR  assistance does Wanda provide?
Wanda currently lets you:

* Submit absence requests for things like vacation, and report sickness absence with or without attachments such as a medical certificate 
* See your previous payslips for last month or any other previous period
* See your vacation, sickness, overtime and flexitime balances

#### What payslip information does Wanda show?
Wanda shows a basic summary of your payslip showing net pay and main totals and wonâ€™t necessarily show every line, so what is shown won't be as detailed as your actual payslip.

To see your payslip information just say something like *Show my payslip* and Wanda will show your most recent one.

If you want to see a specific payslip, then just tell Wanda the date or period by saying something like *Show my payslip for June last year* and Wanda will find that one for you.

#### How do I include supporting documentation in my absence request? 

You can attach supporting documentation to your absence such as a medical certificate, or documentation related to things like parental leave and military leave etc. To attach supporting documentation to your absence request, simply obtain (or create) a PDF version or take a picture of your paper copy, store it on your device and then upload the file to Wanda when asked to do so as part of your absence request.

#### Why can't I attach images in Microsoft Teams?

If you're using the web or desktop versions of Microsoft Teams, then due to a current limitation in Teams, the paperclip icon is missing as default from your Wanda chat channel. This means you're not able to directly attach image files to your chats with Wanda but there is a temporary workaround.

If the paperclip icon is missing from your Wanda chat channel, then to attach image files to your chat you need to open your image file in Microsoft Paint or the default image viewer in Windows 10, select the image and then copy and paste it into the Wanda chat window using the keyboard commands **Ctrl-C** and **Ctrl-V**.
