## Entering timesheets

#### How can Wanda help me with my timesheets?
Wanda helps you to enter your daily, weekly or monthly timesheets by letting you add time, copy time from existing timesheets and make changes to draft timesheets. 

Once you've entered your timesheet and decided to save it, Wanda asks if you want to send it for approval, or you can save it as a draft to update later with Wanda or in Business World.

#### How does Wanda make suggestions for my timesheets?
Wanda uses the following timesheet information to automatically generate daily or weekly timesheets and provide suggestions for project codes and work orders etc.

* Your work schedule to see when you’re scheduled to be working and for how long 
* Your recent timesheet history to see which work task you’ve entered time for
* Any work tasks you’ve marked as favorites
* Any work tasks assigned to you as planned time from People Planner

Your planned work and absence comes from the People Planner Experience pack installed on Business World.

#### Why doesn't Wanda show the project I'm working on?
When you do a timesheet and Wanda doesn't list a project you want to register time for, then this means that you haven't registered time for this project in the last 8 weeks, or you haven't marked it as a favorite in the **Timesheets** window in Business World. In this case you need to go to Business World and add the work task to a recent draft timesheet and Wanda will then recognise it as a recent task. You can also mark the work task as a favorite.

#### How does Wanda distribute time I add to my timesheets?

When you add time to a project for a period, Wanda distributes this time evenly over the period. For example, if you work a five day week and you add 10 hours to a certain project, Wanda adds 2 hours to each day. This allows you to add your time quickly and easily, and if you need to change the time for certain days then you can just ask Wanda to  change the time for those days.
